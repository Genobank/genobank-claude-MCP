## Overview

GenoBank Claude MCP is a tool suite that enables individuals to transform their genomic data into sovereign digital assets using blockchain technology. This project implements the Model-Controller-Presenter (MCP) architecture to provide a secure and user-friendly interface for genomic data management with Claude AI integration.

## Features

- **BioNFT™ Creation**: Transform genomic data into verifiable BioNFTs on blockchain
- **Ancestry Analysis**: Visualize and mint your ancestry composition results as digital assets
- **Data Sovereignty**: Maintain full ownership and control of your genomic data
- **Story Protocol Integration**: Utilize the Story Protocol blockchain for intellectual property registration
- **MetaMask Authentication**: Secure signing and verification of genomic data transactions

## SOMOS Ancestry™

This repository supports the SOMOS Ancestry™ product, the world's first system that allows users to:
- Convert Ancestry DNA data into a sovereign BioIP portfolio
- Visualize ancestry composition across 24 reference populations
- Mint ancestry results as verifiable digital assets
